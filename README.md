# DE_YUV_Recoloring
This Project has published as a conference papers in the ICTC-2019, Jeju Island, South Korea
Differential Evolutionary (DE) Based Interactive Recoloring algorithm for Interior Design is a technique to the realtime recoloring images for use as what users prefer based YUV Algorithm and Differential Evolutionary (DE) Algorithm. An approachment from a combination of several techniques that have been proven for real-time recoloring interior wall paintings. The performance measures of these techniques are good enough for real-time applications. The structural and functional operations of the YUV and DE algorithm are similar to the natural neurons which are completely computational in nature.
